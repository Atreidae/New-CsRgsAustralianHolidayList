## KNOWN ISSUES
   None at this stage, this is however in development code and bugs are expected

## Script Specifics

**EXAMPLE** Adds holiday rule sets to the application server specfied in the ServiceID
`PS C:\> New-CsRgsAustralianHolidayList.ps1 -ServiceID "service:ApplicationServer:SFBFE01.skype4badmin.com/1987d3c2-4544-489d-bbe3-59f79f530a83" -RGSPrepend "RGS-AU-"`

**EXAMPLE** Runs the script and prompts the user for input to select the pool
`PS C:\> New-CsRgsAustralianHolidayList.ps1`

**EXAMPLE** Runs the script in unattended mode and adds/updates the holiday lists on AUMELSFBFE.Skype4badmin.local
`PS C:\> New-CsRgsAustralianHolidayList.ps1 -DisableScriptUpdate -FrontEndPool AUMELSFBFE.Skype4badmin.local -Unattended`

**PARAMETER ServiceID <RgsIdentity>**
Service where the new holiday set will be hosted. For example: -ServiceID "service:ApplicationServer:SFBFE01.Skype4badmin.com/1987d3c2-4544-489d-bbe3-59f79f530a83".
To obtain your service ID, run Get-CsRgsConfiguration -Identity FEPool01.skype4badmin.com
If you dont specify a ServiceID or FrontEndPool, the script will try and guess the frontend to put the holidays on.

**PARAMETER FrontEndPool <FrontEnd FQDN>**
Frontend Pool where the new holiday set will be hosted. 
If you don't specify a ServiceID or FrontEndPool, the script will try and guess the frontend to put the holidays on.
Specifying this instead of ServiceID will cause the script to confirm the pool unless -Unattended is specified

**PARAMETER RGSPrepend <String>**
String to Prepend to Listnames to suit your enviroment

**PARAMETER DisableScriptUpdate**
Stops the script from checking online for an update and prompting the user to download. Ideal for scheduled tasks

**PARAMETER RemoveExistingRules**
Deprecated. Script now updates existing rulesets rather than removing them. Kept for backwards compatability

**PARAMETER Unattended**
Assumes yes for pool selection critera when multiple pools are present and Poolfqdn is specified.
Also stops the script from checking for updates
Check the script works before using this!

**INPUT**
None. New-CsRgsAustralianHolidayList.ps1 does not accept pipelined input.

**Output**
New-CsRgsAustralianHolidayList.ps1 creates multiple new instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Rgs.Management.WritableSettings.HolidaySet object and cannot be piped.
